# Livery Contest Rules

Welcome to the **Livery Contest**! Below, you will find the rules, tips, and flow of the event. Follow these carefully to create stunning liveries and ensure a smooth experience.

## 🚗 Rules
1. **Only clean car designs**:
    - No missile-style liveries. (Do you really want us to inspect how good rust or scratches look?)
2. **150+ layers required**:
    - Ensure your design meets this standard.
3. **Streaming required**:
    - Be ready to stream to verify layer details and showcase your work.

## 💡 Tips for Success
1. **Use advanced techniques for painting:**
    - Avoid basic methods to paint the whole car. Instead, use layered liveries. This allows for easier corrections and ensures color consistency (especially in "CarX" moments).
2. **Think practically:**
    - Imagine applying the livery in real life. Ask yourself:
      *"Would I actually add this tiny decal that doesn’t make sense if it were missing?"*
3. **Trust your instincts:**
    - If you have doubts about a decal passing inspection, it probably won’t. Fix it until you're confident it meets the standard.
4. **Plan for all views:**
    - Lack of a rooftop design should not ruin the overall livery. For cars with convertible variants (e.g., MX-5), make sure the livery works in all configurations.
    - *(Fail examples in attached pictures.)*

## 🔍 What Inspectors Check
Inspectors will evaluate:
1. **Liveries on car part joints.**
2. **Corners and edges.**
3. **Small or unnecessary decals.**
4. **Visible glitches.**
5. **Overstretching of designs.**
6. **Stealth stickers (~hidden decals).**
